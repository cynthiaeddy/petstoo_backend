## Adopt A Pet

Are you longing for a pet but have a circumstance/schedule that prevents you from having one? Adopt a virtual pet! Anytime, anywhere you can feed, walk and play with your pet. The best part is you don't have to clean up after them, or get scolded at by strangers if your pet does something bad.

This App has two Github Repositories. This one is for the Rails API backend. The other one is for the React frontend (link below in instructions).
